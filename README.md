<h1><b>Pothole Detection System using OpenCV</b></h1> <br>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<br>
This project is a real-time pothole detection system built using Python and OpenCV. It processes video input (either from a video file or webcam) to detect potholes based on edge detection and contour analysis.

<h1>Collaboration</h1>
<hr>
<br>
This project was a collaborative effort by me(Nirupam Chakraborty) and my friends(Manash Khatowal, Mousam Deka, Lakhya Jyoti Saikia), where we explored computer vision techniques to solve a real-world problem.

<br>
<h1>Features</h1>

<br>
‣ Real-time video processing (supports both webcam and video files)

‣ Grayscale conversion & Gaussian Blur for noise reduction

‣ Canny Edge Detection for identifying road surface irregularities

‣ Contour Detection to locate potholes

‣ Bounding Box & Labels to highlight detected potholes in the video feed
